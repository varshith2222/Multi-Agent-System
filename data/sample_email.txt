Subject: Urgent: Service Quality Issues

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service quality we have been experiencing lately. This is our third complaint this month.

Key Issues:
1. System downtime: 4 hours yesterday
2. Data synchronization failures
3. Slow response from support team

This is completely unacceptable for a premium service that we are paying $5000/month for. We need immediate resolution or we will be forced to escalate this to senior management.

Please treat this as an urgent matter requiring immediate attention.

Best regards,
John Smith
VP of Operations
